# üîç Entity Matching with Deep Learning

> Solving the age-old problem of "Is this the same product?" using AI magic ‚ú®

## üéØ What's This All About?

Have you ever wondered how online shopping platforms know when two different product listings are actually the same item? That's exactly what this project tackles! 

Imagine you're comparing products from Amazon and Google Shopping. The same laptop might be listed as "Dell XPS 13 Laptop" on Amazon and "Dell XPS-13 9310 Core i7" on Google. They look different, but they're the same product! This project uses a combination of traditional machine learning and cutting-edge deep learning to figure that out automatically.

## ü§î Why Does This Matter?

Entity matching (also called record linkage or data deduplication) is everywhere:
- **E-commerce**: Merge product catalogs from different sources
- **Data Integration**: Combine databases with duplicate entries
- **Price Comparison**: Match products across different retailers
- **Market Research**: Track the same product across multiple platforms

Getting this right means better search results, accurate price comparisons, and cleaner databases!

## üß† The Smart Approach

This project doesn't just use one technique - it combines the best of both worlds:

### 1. **Traditional Machine Learning Features** üîß
We extract meaningful features like:
- **Jaccard Similarity**: How many words do the titles share?
- **Edit Distance**: How many changes needed to transform one title to another?
- **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity**: Smart text comparison that knows which words matter
- **N-gram Overlap**: Character-level pattern matching
- **Price Similarity**: Products should have similar prices, right?

### 2. **Deep Learning Power** üöÄ
We leverage state-of-the-art transformers:
- **RoBERTa Embeddings**: A powerful language model that understands context and meaning
- **Semantic Similarity**: Goes beyond keywords to understand what products actually are

### 3. **Ensemble Methods** üé≠
We don't pick just one model - we test multiple classifiers:
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Gradient Boosting
- Logistic Regression

The best performer wins! (Spoiler: Usually gets approximately 88%+ F1-score üéâ)

## üìä The Dataset

The project works with real-world product data:

**Amazon.csv**: Product listings from Amazon
- ID, title, description, manufacturer, price

**GoogleProducts.csv**: Product listings from Google Shopping
- ID, name, description, manufacturer, price

**candidate_pairs.csv**: Labeled pairs of products
- Amazon ID, Google ID, and whether they match (1) or not (0)

The dataset contains over 120,000 product pairs with about 8% positive matches - a realistic imbalanced scenario!

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project leverages a powerful tech stack:

- **Python 3.10+**: The language of choice
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: For RoBERTa embeddings
- **Sentence-Transformers**: Easy semantic similarity
- **Scikit-learn**: Traditional ML algorithms and metrics
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting at its finest
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Beautiful visualizations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhinav0905/Entity_Matching.git
cd Entity_Matching
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install transformers torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install sentence-transformers python-Levenshtein scikit-learn xgboost pandas numpy
pip install matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Usage

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook advanced_entity_matching.ipynb
```

2. **Run the cells step by step** to:
   - Load and explore the data
   - Extract traditional ML features
   - Generate RoBERTa embeddings
   - Train multiple models
   - Compare performance
   - Analyze results

3. **The notebook will**:
   - Train various models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
   - Generate performance metrics (F1-score, Precision, Recall)
   - Create visualizations comparing models
   - Perform error analysis on misclassified pairs
   - Save the best model for future use

## üìà Performance

The hybrid approach achieves impressive results:

- **F1-Score**: Approximately 88%+ (depending on the model)
- **Precision**: High accuracy when predicting matches
- **Recall**: Good coverage of actual matches

The model generates a comparison chart (`model_comparison.png`) showing performance across different approaches:
- Traditional features only
- RoBERTa embeddings only
- Hybrid approach (usually the winner! üèÜ)

## üîç What's Inside?

### Feature Engineering
- String similarity metrics (Jaccard, edit distance, n-grams)
- TF-IDF vectorization with cosine similarity
- Numerical feature comparison (prices)
- Manufacturer and description matching

### Deep Learning
- RoBERTa-based semantic embeddings
- Contextual understanding of product descriptions
- Transfer learning from pre-trained language models

### Model Training
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Ensemble comparison
- Feature importance analysis

### Evaluation
- Confusion matrices
- Precision-Recall trade-offs
- Error analysis (false positives & negatives)
- Detailed performance metrics

## üéØ Results Visualization

The project generates several insightful visualizations:

1. **model_comparison.png**: Side-by-side comparison of all models
2. **Feature importance charts**: Which features matter most?
3. **Confusion matrices**: Where does the model make mistakes?

## üîÆ Future Improvements

There's always room to grow! Potential enhancements:

- [ ] Experiment with other transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT)
- [ ] Add attention mechanisms to highlight important features
- [ ] Implement active learning for better data labeling
- [ ] Create a REST API for real-time predictions
- [ ] Build a web interface for easy product matching
- [ ] Scale to handle millions of products
- [ ] Add support for multilingual product catalogs
